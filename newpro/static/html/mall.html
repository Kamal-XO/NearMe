Abirami Mega Mall in Chennai’s Purasaiwalkam will be downing its shutters on January 31, 2019 for renovations. The complex that was inaugurated in 1976 had just two theatres initially. In 1982 two more theatres were added, all of which are functional even today.
Abirami Ramanathan, Managing Director of Abirami Mega Mall and President of Tamil Nadu Cinema Theatre Owners’ Federation shares their plan to construct a 16-floor commercial and residential complex.
“With digital invasion, we have realised that 1000-seater theatres are not working for the audience anymore. The new building will have ground plus two floors for commercial purposes with 10 theatre screens. The rest of the 14 floors above will have independent flats,” he says.
Ramanathan also adds that the idea is to build a self-sufficient complex that will cater to all the needs for those living in the residential floors above. “People living in these floors need not go anywhere. Everything will be made available,” he says,

The property will be constructed by Rainbow Constructions Private Limited and demolition will commence February 1. “Bhoomi puja has been planned for first week of May and the property will be unveiled in 18 months from then,” adds Ramanathan.
Spread across 28 grounds (1.5 acres), Singapore-based structural engineer has been roped in to work on it. The owners of Abirami Mega Mall boast that their’s was the first of its kind mall in Tamil Nadu. Their Swarna Sakthi Abirami and Shree Annai Abirami were attributed as the first 5-star theatres in the country. The ambience in these theatres were modelled around Egyptian and Chinese palaces. Their Abirami theatre, modelled to look like the Spanish Opera House was called the first seven-star theatre in the country.
