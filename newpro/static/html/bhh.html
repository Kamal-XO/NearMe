One of the oldest Vegiterian North Indian restaurant in Chennai with the traditional cooking flavours and taste, bombay halwa house is the original restaurant available today to try out North Indian foods in Chennai!
.
We had an awesome dinner from lassi, rotis, Manchurian, gravies to falooda and everything were rich in taste and quantity was appreciative!
.
I started with Spl.BHH lassi, it was so thick and tasty, it was filled with malai at the bottom which have additional taste to it!
.
Then we had chilly paneer and mushroom Manchurian with papad as staters. They were well fried and presented well. It were crispy and fresh to taste.
